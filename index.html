WEEK 2: Today we had to design something of our choice in tnkercad. I chose my airpods, which was super hard to make. It looked like dookie after. It was fun though. On wednesday we went through some saftey stuff, stuff that people should already know cause its just common sense. The video was funny though. On monday, we learned about engineering professions and what each one does.

WEEK 3: This week, we ended up doing a paper E for our challenge. We basically just had to draw a paper E with certain measurements, then we switched with someone and made an exact replica of their E, with the exact measurements. It was basically just the same thing they drew but cut out. Very simple stuff. It was to teach us that measurements were absolutely important, and that we shouldn't like skip any of the measurements or there will be problems.

WEEK 4: This challenge was a group project. Usually teams of 4 people, we all made our own paper boats. I didn't really know how to make a paper boat, so I had to do some minor research before. In the end, my ended up sucking anyways. We decided on a boat, and part of the challenge was having weights put onto the boats. Who ever had the most weight and had their boat float at the same time won. I ended up overestimating how much our boat could take, and it just sunk. My boat ended up floating without weights but  it was still bad. I think if we had more attempts to make different boats with different weights we probably would have had a better chance of winning.

WEEK 5: Our project was the Rude Goldberg project. We basically had to make a mechanism that popped a balloon in the end, but in like a complicated way. So our group decided to build this thingy (ill have photos up soon, right now im having trouble with it) and it all started with a lever. You hit the lever to push the ball down a slope, which hits a car with a needle on it and makes it pop the balloon. We had some trial and error here and there, but luckliy we had used tinkercad in order to kinda get a general feel on what it was going to look like and how big it would be. At first, the  balloon didn't pop because it was too elevated off the ground. So we just had to tape it on its top and it worked first try.

WEEK 6:Today we disected a laptop. It was very old, and it was a very tedious process. It took forever, due to some problems, but in the end we got it. I am pretty sure that I messed up on every part, since I didn't really understand what was what cause of how outdated it was. After we were done, we had to put it back together, which was even harder because we got screws mixed up, wires got stuck, everything was out of place.

WEEK 7: absent

WEEK 8: Today we had to make a flying paper object that could hit a trashcan. The drawbacks were that we were limited to one piece of paper and we were on the second story of a building. It had me thinking, cause I had never made a paper airplane before. And then I thought, it doesn't have to be a paper airplane. The directions said OBJECT. So what did I do? I rolled it into a ball. Literally, all I did. And it almost hit the trashcan, but my aim sucks so it wasn't exactly what I needed to do.
