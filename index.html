Today we had to design something of our choice in tnkercad. I chose my airpods, which was super hard to make. It looked like dookie after. It was fun though. On wednesday we went through some saftey stuff, stuff that people should already know cause its just common sense. The video was funny though. On monday, we learned about engineering professions and what each one does.
