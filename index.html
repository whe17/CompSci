WEEK 2: Today we had to design something of our choice in tnkercad. I chose my airpods, which was super hard to make. It looked like dookie after. It was fun though. On wednesday we went through some saftey stuff, stuff that people should already know cause its just common sense. The video was funny though. On monday, we learned about engineering professions and what each one does.

WEEK 3: This week, we ended up doing a paper E for our challenge. We basically just had to draw a paper E with certain measurements, then we switched with someone and made an exact replica of their E, with the exact measurements. It was basically just the same thing they drew but cut out. Very simple stuff. It was to teach us that measurements were absolutely important, and that we shouldn't like skip any of the measurements or there will be problems.

WEEK 4: This challenge was a group project. Usually teams of 4 people, we all made our own paper boats. I didn't really know how to make a paper boat, so I had to do some minor research before. In the end, my ended up sucking anyways. We decided on a boat, and part of the challenge was having weights put onto the boats. Who ever had the most weight and had their boat float at the same time won. I ended up overestimating how much our boat could take, and it just sunk. My boat ended up floating without weights but  it was still bad. I think if we had more attempts to make different boats with different weights we probably would have had a better chance of winning.

WEEK 5: Our project was the Rude Goldberg project. We basically had to make a mechanism that popped a balloon in the end, but in like a complicated way. So our group decided to build this thingy (ill have photos up soon, right now im having trouble with it) and it all started with a lever. You hit the lever to push the ball down a slope, which hits a car with a needle on it and makes it pop the balloon. We had some trial and error here and there, but luckliy we had used tinkercad in order to kinda get a general feel on what it was going to look like and how big it would be. At first, the  balloon didn't pop because it was too elevated off the ground. So we just had to tape it on its top and it worked first try.
